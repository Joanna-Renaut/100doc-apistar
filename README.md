# Working with API Star

This project was for days 9-12 of the #100daysofcode #100daysofweb with talkpython and pybites

I took mock data from Mockaroo (https://mockaroo.com/) from the health section. This included 1000 rows of:
 - NHS number
 - ICD10 Diagnosis Code
 - ICD10 Dx Desc (Long)
 - Drug Name (Generic)
 - Drug Company

in JSON format.

I learned how to create functions to GET, POST, PUT and DELETE from an API as well as learning basic tests

It was fun creating the smaller functions to create a unique NHS number when new patients were added.
